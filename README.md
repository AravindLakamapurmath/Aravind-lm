I have used 4 servo motors to make joints of the robotic arm and the movement will be controlled with the help of potentiometer. The controller used is Arduino UNO. The analogue input signals of the Arduino's is given to the Potentiometer. The arm has been built by the Cardboard and individual parts are attached to the respective servo motors. The arm is specifically created to pick and place light weight objects. So low torque servos, with a rotation of 0 to 180 degrees have been used. Programming is done using Arduino 1.6.10. Thus the paper basically focuses on creating a robotic arm with non useful materials and its application on small purposes.
